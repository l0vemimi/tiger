### approaches

**passive** collection: 

prefered way to gather information; you ***do not interact with the target(s)*** at all e.g. messaging, sending friend requests, liking posts, following their accounts. instead collecting information without ever making the target aware, providing better opsec. these include:

- searching targets name online to find accounts
- looking up targets email address in data breaches and leaks
- saving posts, images and videos from a targets social media account
- looking up historical whois and dns record for a target domain

**active** collection: 

a way that is not reccommended and would have you making contact with the target, which could bring heat or risk spooking them into hiding thier online presence. this should be done properly using a sock puppet with a vpn or disposable vm. this includes:

- sending the target a friend or follow request from a sock account
- sending a private message of any kind
- liking, commenting or sharing the targets posts
- scanning a target website or device
