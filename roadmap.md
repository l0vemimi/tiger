## hardware

**CPU** - a ***central processing unit*** executes instructions of a computer program such as arithmetic, logic, controlling and input / output operations

**GPU** - ***graphical processing unit*** is designed for digital image processing and to accelerate computer graphics, being present either as a discrete video card or embedded on motherboards, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles

**RAM** - ***random access memory*** is a form of electronic computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code; they allow data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory

**motherboard** - holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the cpu and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals

**HDD** - ***hard disk drive***, an electro-mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage with one or more rigid rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material; the platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surface; data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order; HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data when powered off; modern HDDs are typically in the form of a small rectangular box

**SSD** - ***solid state drive***, a type of solid storage device that uses integrated circuits to store data persistently; they rely on non-volatile memory and unlike HDDs, have no moving parts, allowing them to deliver faster data access speed, reduced latency, increased resistance to physical shock, lower power consumption and silent operation

**PSU** - ***power supply unit*** converts mains AC or wall power to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a desktop

**input devices** - equipment used to provide data and control signals to an information processing system, such as a computer or information appliance, e.g. *keyboards, computer mice, scanners, cameras, joysticks,* and *microphones*

**output devices** - hardware that converts information or data into a human-perceptible form or, historically, into a physical machine-readable form for use with other non-computerized equipment; it can be text, graphics, tactile, audio, or video e.g. *monitors, printers* and *sound cards*

## connection types

**bluetooth** - short-range wireless technology standard used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances; while it offers convenience for connecting peripherals and transferring information, it also presents several security concerns in the cybersecurity landscape; **bluetooth vulnerabilities** can potentially allow attackers to intercept communications, execute malicious code, or gain unauthorized access to devices; **common attacks include bluejacking, bluesnarfing, and bluebugging**; to mitigate these risks, cybersecurity professionals recommend regularly updating device firmware, using the latest bluetooth protocols, enabling encryption, and turning off bluetooth when not in use; despite ongoing security improvements, bluetooth remains an attack vector that requires vigilant monitoring and protection in both personal and enterprise environments

**infared** -  type of wireless communication technology that utilizes light waves in the electromagnetic spectrum to transmit data between devices; infrared connections are widely used in short-range communication, commonly found in devices like **remote controls, wireless keyboards and mice, and computer-to-printer communication**

**NFC** - ***near field communication*** is a short-range wireless technology that allows devices to communicate and exchange data over very short distances, typically up to 10 cm; NFC is commonly used for applications such as contactless payments, electronic ticketing, and data transfer between devices; it operates at a frequency of 13.56 MHz and supports various modes, including peer-to-peer communication, card emulation, and reader/writer modes; NFC enables quick and secure interactions with minimal setup, making it convenient for mobile payments, access control, and sharing information

**wifi** - a wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to the internet and communicate with each other without physical cables; it uses radio waves to transmit data, typically operating on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands; wifi networks are created by wireless routers or access points and can be found in homes, offices, public spaces, and many other locations; the technology follows IEEE 802.11 standards, with newer versions e.g. wifi 6 or 802.11ax, offering increased speeds, better performance in crowded areas, and improved energy efficiency; wifi enables the proliferation of mobile and smart devices, supporting the internet of things or *IoT* and allowing for greater flexibility and mobility in network connectivity

**IoT** - ***internet of things*** describes devices with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communication networks

## computer networking

computer networking is the practice of connecting computers and devices to share data and resources; involving use of **protocols like TCP/IP for communication, hardware such as routers and switches for directing traffic, and various network topologies** (star, mesh, bus) for organizing connections

networks can be categorized by size and scope, from **small local area networks** (***LANs***) to **wide area networks** (***WANs***) that span large geographical areas; key concepts include **IP addressing, subnetting, DNS** for name resolution, and network security measures
