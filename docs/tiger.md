## hardware

**CPU** - a ***central processing unit*** executes instructions of a computer program such as arithmetic, logic, controlling and input / output operations

**GPU** - ***graphical processing unit*** is designed for digital image processing and to accelerate computer graphics, being present either as a discrete video card or embedded on motherboards, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles

**RAM** - ***random access memory*** is a form of electronic computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code; they allow data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory

**motherboard** - holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the cpu and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals

**HDD** - ***hard disk drive***, an electro-mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage with one or more rigid rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material; the platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surface; data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order; HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data when powered off; modern HDDs are typically in the form of a small rectangular box

**SSD** - ***solid state drive***, a type of solid storage device that uses integrated circuits to store data persistently; they rely on non-volatile memory and unlike HDDs, have no moving parts, allowing them to deliver faster data access speed, reduced latency, increased resistance to physical shock, lower power consumption and silent operation

**PSU** - ***power supply unit*** converts mains AC or wall power to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a desktop

**input devices** - equipment used to provide data and control signals to an information processing system, such as a computer or information appliance, e.g. *keyboards, computer mice, scanners, cameras, joysticks,* and *microphones*

**output devices** - hardware that converts information or data into a human-perceptible form or, historically, into a physical machine-readable form for use with other non-computerized equipment; it can be text, graphics, tactile, audio, or video e.g. *monitors, printers* and *sound cards*

## connections

**bluetooth** - short-range wireless technology standard used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances; while it offers convenience for connecting peripherals and transferring information, it also presents several security concerns in the cybersecurity landscape; **bluetooth vulnerabilities** can potentially allow attackers to intercept communications, execute malicious code, or gain unauthorized access to devices; **common attacks include bluejacking, bluesnarfing, and bluebugging**; to mitigate these risks, cybersecurity professionals recommend regularly updating device firmware, using the latest bluetooth protocols, enabling encryption, and turning off bluetooth when not in use; despite ongoing security improvements, bluetooth remains an attack vector that requires vigilant monitoring and protection in both personal and enterprise environments

**infared** -  type of wireless communication technology that utilizes light waves in the electromagnetic spectrum to transmit data between devices; infrared connections are widely used in short-range communication, commonly found in devices like **remote controls, wireless keyboards and mice, and computer-to-printer communication**

**NFC** - ***near field communication*** is a short-range wireless technology that allows devices to communicate and exchange data over very short distances, typically up to 10 cm; NFC is commonly used for applications such as contactless payments, electronic ticketing, and data transfer between devices; it operates at a frequency of 13.56 MHz and supports various modes, including peer-to-peer communication, card emulation, and reader/writer modes; NFC enables quick and secure interactions with minimal setup, making it convenient for mobile payments, access control, and sharing information

**wifi** - a wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to the internet and communicate with each other without physical cables; it uses radio waves to transmit data, typically operating on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands; wifi networks are created by wireless routers or access points and can be found in homes, offices, public spaces, and many other locations; the technology follows IEEE 802.11 standards, with newer versions e.g. wifi 6 or 802.11ax, offering increased speeds, better performance in crowded areas, and improved energy efficiency; wifi enables the proliferation of mobile and smart devices, supporting the internet of things or *IoT* and allowing for greater flexibility and mobility in network connectivity

**IoT** - ***internet of things*** describes devices with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communication networks

**computer networking** - the practice of connecting computers and devices to share data and resources; involving use of **protocols like TCP/IP for communication, hardware such as routers and switches for directing traffic, and various network topologies** (star, mesh, bus) for organizing connections; networks can be categorized by size and scope, from **small local area networks** (***LANs***) to **wide area networks** (***WANs***) that span large geographical areas; key concepts include **IP addressing, subnetting, DNS** for name resolution, and network security measures

## frameworks

### TTP

**tactics, techniques & procedures** is a concept to identify individual patterns of behaviour of a particular terrorist activity and to examine and categorise more general tactics and weapons used by a particular terrorist activity

### diamond model 

framework for analysing intrusions and mapping the relations between attacker, their tools, and the infastructure used to preform the attack; it's used to organise an structure intrusion analysis by categorising data into **four** components:

**adversary**: who did the attack?

**capability**: how did they do it?

**victim**: who was the target?

**infastructure**: what was used?

1. adversary

this is who is behind the attack; it can be broken down into two roles:

- **adversary operator**: the individual directly preforming the attack
- **adversary customer** the entity that benefits from the attack being preformed

an adversary can assume both of these roles or just one; typically a high-profile cyber attack involves multiple operation teams: one for initial access and another for developing the malware, and a third for exfiltrating data; the ransomware scene has adopted this structure where you will have an initial access broker providing a service, a ransomware gang lisencing their software and an affiliate preforming the attack

to start, track the online presence used, accounts seen e.g. email, social media and the intent of the attackl allowing to be able to corrolate attribute of the attack to an entity based on available data

2. capability

capability refers to the [TTPs](#ttp) the adversary uses to preform the attack; this can be categorised into:

- **tools**: the hacking tools, malware or exploit used in the attack
- **tradecraft**: the hacking technique used by the adversary e.g. exploiting [LOLBAS](#lolbas) or commands run on the system

when mapping capabilities to the diamond model, focus on datapoints that stand out, usually represented in choices an adversary will make e.g. specific malware configuration chosen, custom malware used, novel attack techniques, command line options

1. infastructure

the adversary will deploy their capabilities using infastructure, this is anything the attacker uses to deliver their capabilities; common types of infastructure:

- service accounts
- email address
- ip address
- domains
- c2 servers
- personas e.g. social media, phone numbers
- cloud services
- file shareing websites
- tor nodes
- compromised websites

4. victim

the recipient of the attack or "capabilities deployed across infastructure by the adversary"

the diamond model can be applied in combination with attack frameworks such as [cyber kill chain](#cyber-kill-chain) by associating each diamond model componenet ,where every data point or piece of evidence collected related to that stage can be mapped to an adversary, victim, infastructure or capability

### cyber kill chain

outline stages of an offensive attack and can be used as a counter measure framework and improve defence; there are several phrases in the model:

1. **reconnaissance**: getting information on the target and identifying vulnerabilities
2. **weaponisation**: creating remote access weapons such as viruses, worms or anything tailored to the vulnerabilities
3. **delivery**: transmitting the weapon to the target e.g. email attachments, websites, usb
4. **exploitation**: malware weapon's program code triggers, taking action on the target network to exploit the vulnerability
5. **installation**: malware weapon installs an access point e.g. a backdoor
6. **command & control**: aka ***C2***; malware weapon allows access to have persistent access to the target network and remote access
7. **actions on objectives**: action on goals and achievements are taken e.g. data exfiltration, data destruction, encryption, ransom 

defensive actions that can be taken against thes phases are:

1. **detect**: determine weather an intruder is present
2. **deny**: prevent information disclosure and unauthorised access 
3. **disrupt**: stop or change outbound traffic to the attacker
4. **degrade**: counter-attack command and control
5. **decieve**: interfere with command and control
6. **contain**: network segmentation changes

an alternative to cyber kill chain is ***FireEye***, a more linear model where the persistence of threates are emphasized, stressing that a *threat does not end after one cycle*; outlined below:

1. **reconnaissance**: the initial phase of gathering information on the target, involving: scanning for vulnerabilities, researching potential entry points, identifying potential targets within the organisation
2. **initial intrusion**: once enough information is gained, attempting to breach the system, which can involve: exploiting software vulnerabilities, systems, social engineering or other methods to gain initial access
3. **establishing a backdoor**: after initial access, creating a backdoor or persistent entry point into the compromised system; ensuring there is still access even if the initial breach is discovered
4. **obtain user credentials**: stealing user credentials which can involve: keylogging, phishing or exploiting weak authentication methods
5. **install various utilities**: installing various tools, utilities or malware on the compromised system to facilitate further movement, data collection, or control; these tools can include **RATs** - *remote access trojans*, **keyloggers and other types of malicious software
6. **privelage escalation / lateral movement / data exfiltration**: once inside the system, privelage escalation is done to gain more control over the network, moving laterally within the network and trying to access more valuable systems or sensitive data; data exfiltration involves stealing and transmitting valuable information out of the network
7. **maintain persistence**: this stage emphasizes the goal to maintain long-term presence within the compromised environment; by continuously evading detection, updating tools and adapting to any security measures put in place

another alternative to cyber kill chain is ATT&CK below

### ATT&CK

**adversarial tactics, techniques & common knowledge**:

is a common guideline for classifying and describing cyberattacks and intrusions; rather looking at the results of an attack or ***IoC*** - *indicator of compromise*, it identifies tactics that indicate an attack is in progress

the framework consists of 14 tactics categories consisting of "technical objectives" of an adversary, these subcategories are then further broken down into specific techniques and sub-techniques; [MITRE ATT&CK matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/#) lists all categories, subcategories and tecnhiques in detail

## attacks

### malware

**malware**, short for ***malicious software***, refers to any software intentionally created to cause harm to a computer system, server, network, or user; it is a broad term that encompasses various types of harmful software created by cybercriminals for various purposes

**virus** is a type of malware that, much like a biological virus, attaches itself to a host (e.g., a file or software) and replicates when the host is executed; viruses can corrupt, delete or modify data, and slow down system performance

**worms** are self-replicating malware that spread through networks without human intervention; they exploit system vulnerabilities, consuming bandwidth and sometimes carrying a payload to infect target machines

**trojan horse** is a piece of software disguised as a legitimate program but contains harmful code; users unknowingly download and install it, giving the attacker unauthorized access to the computer or network; trojans can be used to steal data, create a backdoor, or launch additional malware attacks
 
**ransomware** is a type of malware that encrypts its victims’ files and demands a ransom, typically in the form of cryptocurrency, for the decryption key; if the victim refuses or fails to pay within a specified time, the encrypted data may be lost forever

**spyware** is a type of malware designed to collect and relay information about a user or organization without their consent it can capture keystrokes, record browsing history, and access personal data such as usernames and passwords

**adware** is advertising-supported software that automatically displays or downloads advertising materials, often in the form of pop-up ads, on a user’s computer; while not always malicious, adware can be intrusive and open the door for other malware infections

**rootkit** is a type of malware designed to hide or obscure the presence of other malicious programs on a computer system; this enables it to maintain persistent unauthorized access to the system and can make it difficult for users or security software to detect and remove infected files

**keyloggers** are a type of malware that monitor and record users’ keystrokes, allowing attackers to capture sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial information entered on a keyboard

### LOLBAS

**living off the land binaries and scripts** is a method of attack of execurables, scripts and libaries that already exist on a computer, provided by the operating system or come from trusted sources; to be classified as such, they must provide functions:

- execute program code or scripts
- compile program code
- bypass user account control
- read network traffic or user activity
- side load or hijack DLLs
- process memory dumping
- read login credentials
- file operations e.g. gile downloads and uploads

LOLBAS attacks work by using legitimate binaries to carry out malicious activities, these tools are often already present on the victims computer and can be used by attackers to evade detection by security software, e.g. an attacker can use a powershell script that is already present on the system to download and execute additional malicious coude, since powershell is a legitimate tool it may not be flagged as suspicious

### honeypots

decoy systems or networks designed to attract and detect unauthorized access attempts by cybercriminals,these intentionally vulnerable resources mimic legitimate targets, allowing security professionals to study attack techniques, gather threat intelligence, and divert attackers from actual critical systems; honeypots can range from low-interaction systems that simulate basic services to high-interaction ones that replicate entire network environments

they serve multiple purposes in cybersecurity: early warning systems for detecting new attack vectors, research tools for understanding attacker behavior, and diversions to waste hackers’ time and resources

deploying honeypots requires careful consideration, as they can potentially introduce risks if not properly isolated from production environments; advanced honeypots may incorporate machine learning to adapt to evolving threats and provide more convincing decoys; while honeypots are powerful tools for proactive defense, they should be part of a comprehensive security strategy rather than a standalone solution

## network

### OSI

***open system interconnection*** or the **OSI** model has 7 layers to describe networked communication from one computer to another, with each layer having a specific communication puurpose to ensure reliable data flow; each layer is independant and self contained with the application layer being at the top and physical layer at the bottom

**PDU** or ***protocol data unit*** is what each layer's information is referred as; each layer will add or delete its protocol information as a PDU moves up or down each layer; it refers to a block of information that is transferred between network end systems

#### layer 1: physical

PDU: **bit, symbol** 

function: **media, signal and binary transmission**

responsible for the transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between a device, such as a network interface controller, Ethernet hub, or network switch, and a physical transmission medium

#### layer 2: data link

PDU: **frame**

function: **physical addressing**

provides node-to-node data transfer—a link between two directly connected nodes; detects and possibly corrects errors that may occur in the physical layer; defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices; there are two sublayers:

- **MAC**: ***medium access control*** - responsible for controlling how devices in a network gain access to a medium and permission to transmit data 
- **LLC**: ***logical link control*** - responsible for identifying and encapsulating network layer protocols, and controls error checking and frame synchronisation

the MAC and LLC layers of IEEE 802 networks such as 803.3 ethernet and 802.11 wifi operate at the data link layer

#### layer 3: network

PDU: **packet**

function: **path determination and logical addressing**

provides the functional and procedural means of transferring packets from one node to another connected in "different networks"; network is a medium to which many nodes can be connected, on which every node has an address and which permits nodes connected to it to transfer messages to other nodes connected to it by merely providing the content of a message and the address of the destination node and letting the network find the way to deliver the message to the destination node, possibly routing it through intermediate nodes; if the message is too large to be transmitted from one node to another on the data link layer between those nodes, the network may implement message delivery by splitting the message into several fragments at one node, sending the fragments independently, and reassembling the fragments at another node

#### layer 4: transport

PDU: **segment, datagram**

function: **end-to-end conections an reliability**

provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source host to a destination host from one application to another across a network, while maintaining the quality-of-service functions; transport protocols may be connection-oriented or connectionless

it may require breaking large protocol data units or long data streams into smaller chunks called **segments**, since the network layer imposes a maximum packet size called **MTU** or ***maximum transmission units***, which depends on the maximum packet size imposed by all data link layers on the network path between the two hosts; the amount of data in a data segment must be small enough to allow for a network-layer header and a transport-layer header

e.g. data being transferred across **ethernet**: the MTU is 1500 bytes, the minimum size of a TCP header is 20 bytes, and the minimum size of an IPv4 header is 20 bytes, so the maximum segment size is 1500−(20+20) bytes, or 1460 bytes

the process of dividing data into segments is called **segmentation**; it is an optional function of the transport layer; Some connection-oriented transport protocols such as **TCP** and the OSI **COTP**, perform segmentation and reassembly of segments on the receiving side; connectionless transport protocols, such as **UDP** and the OSI **CLTP**, usually do not

transport layer also controls the reliability of a given link between a source and destination host through flow control, error control, and acknowledgments of sequence and existence; some protocols are state- and connection-oriented, this means that the transport layer can keep track of the segments and retransmit those that fail delivery through the acknowledgment **hand-shake system**; the transport layer will also provide the acknowledgement of the successful data transmission and sends the next data if no errors occurred

reliability is not a strict requirement within the transport layer;**protocols like UDP are used in applications that are willing to accept some packet loss, reordering, errors or duplication**; streaming media, real-time multiplayer games and **VoIP** are examples of applications where loss of packets is not usually a fatal problem

there are five classes of connection-mode transport protocols, ranging from class 0 or ***TP0***: provides the fewest features, to class 4 or ***TP4**: designed for less reliable networks, similar to the internet:

| TP0 | TP1 | TP2 | TP3 | TP4 | FEATURE                       |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----------------------------- |
| YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | connection-oriented network   |
| NO  | NO  | NO  | NO  | YES | connectionless network        |
| NO  | YES | YES | YES | YES | concatenation and seperation  |
| YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | segmentaion and reassembly    |
| NO  | YES | YES | YES | YES | error recovery                |
| NO  | YES | NO  | YES | NO  | reinitiate connection         |
| NO  | NO  | YES | YES | YES | multiplexing / demultiplexing |
| NO  | NO  | YES | YES | YES | explicit flow control         |
| NO  | NO  | NO  | NO  | YES | retransmission on timeout     |
| NO  | YES | NO  | YES | YES | reliable transport service    |

class 0 contains no error recovery and was designed for use on network layers that provide error-free connections; class 4 is closest to TCP, although TCP contains functions, such as the graceful close, which OSI assigns to the session layer; although not developed under the OSI Reference Model and not strictly conforming to the OSI definition of the transport layer, TCP and UDP are commonly categorized as layer 4 protocols within OSI; TLS does not strictly fit inside the model either, it contains characteristics of the transport and presentation layers

#### layer 5: session

PDU: **data**

function: **interhost communication**

session layer creates the setup, controls the connections, and ends the teardown, between two or more computers, which is called a "session"; common functions of the session layer include: **user logon** or ***establishment*** and **user logoff** or ***termination*** functions

authentication methods are also built into most client software e.g. **FTP client** and **NFS client** for microsoft networks; therefore, the **session layer establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application**

the session layer also provides for full-duplex, half-duplex, or simplex operation and establishes procedures for checkpointing, suspending, restarting, and terminating a session between two related streams of data, such as an audio and a video stream in a web-conferencing application; therefore, the session layer is commonly implemented explicitly in application environments that use remote procedure calls

#### layer 6: presentaion

PDU: **data**

function: **data representation and encryption**

presentation layer establishes data formatting and data translation into a format specified by the application layer during the encapsulation of outgoing messages while being passed down the protocol stack, and possibly reversed during the deencapsulation of incoming messages when being passed up the protocol stack; for this very reason, **outgoing messages during encapsulation are converted into a format specified by the application layer**, while the conversion for **incoming messages during deencapsulation are reversed**; 

presentation layer handles:

- protocol conversion
- data encryption
- data decryption
- data compression
- data decompression
- incompatibility of data representation between operating systems
- graphic commands

the presentation layer transforms data into the form that the application layer accepts, to be sent across a network; since the presentation layer converts data and graphics into a display format for the application layer, the **presentation layer is sometimes called the syntax layer**; for this reason, the presentation layer negotiates the transfer of syntax structure through the basic encoding rules of **ASN.1** or ***abstract syntax notation one***, with capabilities such as converting an EBCDIC-coded text file to an ASCII-coded file, or serialisation of objects and other data structures from and to XML

#### layer 7: application

PDU: **data**

function: **nework process to application**

the application layer is the layer that is closest to the end user, meaning both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with a software application that implements a component of communication between the client and server e.g. file explorer, microsoft word; such application programs fall outside the scope of the OSI model unless they are directly integrated into the application layer through the functions of communication, as is the case with applications such as web browsers and email programs; other examples of software are microsoft network software for file and printer sharing and Linux network file system client for access to shared file resources

functions typically include file sharing, message handling, and database access, through the most common protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMB/CIFS, TFTP, and SMTP; when identifying communication partners, the application layer determines the identity and availability of communication partners for an application with data to transmit; 

the most important distinction in the application layer is the distinction between the application-entity and the application e.g. a reservation website might have two application-entities: one using HTTP to communicate with its users, and one for a remote database protocol to record reservations; neither of these protocols have anything to do with reservations, that logic is in the application itself

the application layer has no means to determine the availability of resources in the network

#### internet protocols

**dividing data into packets**: when you send information over the internet, IP split it into small parts called packets;each packet contains a piece of the data and the address of where it needs to go

**addressing**: every device connected to the internet has its own IP address; this address helps identify where the data is being sent from and where it should be delivered

**routing** the packets**: as the packets travel across the internet, they pass through several devices called routers; these routers help direct the packets toward the correct destination, like how mail is sorted at different post offices

**reassemble the data**: once all the packets arrive at the destination, they are put back together to recreate the original message or file

**handling missing packets**: if some packets don’t arrive, the system can request that they be sent again, making sure the complete data is received
s
##### TCP/IP

***transmission control protocol / internet protocol***

internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received; this functionality is organized into four abstraction layers, which classify all related protocols according to each protocol's scope of networking; an implementation of the layers for a particular application forms a protocol stack From lowest to highest, the layers are: the **link layer**, containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment; the **internet layer**, providing internetworking between independent networks; the **transport layer**, handling host-to-host communication; and the **application layer**, providing process-to-process data exchange for applications

##### SMTP

***simple mail transfer protocol***

this protocol uses the header of the mail to get the email id of the receiver and enters the mail into the queue of outgoing mail; as soon as it delivers the mail to the receiving email id, it removes the email from the outgoing list; the message or the electronic mail may consider the text, video, image, etc

##### PPP

***point to point protocol***

communication protocol that is used to create a direct connection between two communicating devices; this protocol defines the rules using which two devices will authenticate with each other and exchange information with each other e.g. user connects his PC to the server of an ISP and also uses PPP.; smilarly, for connecting two routers for direct communication it uses PPP

##### FTP

***file transfer protocol***

used for transferring files from one system to the other and works on a client-server model; when a machine requests for file transfer from another machine, the FTO sets up a connection between the two and authenticates each other using their ID and password and the desired file transfer takes place between the machines

##### SFTP

***secure file transfer protocol***

also known as SSH FTP refers to file transfer protocol over secure shell as it encrypts both commands and data while in transmission; SFTP acts as an extension to SSH and encrypts files and data then sends them over a secure shell data stream; this protocol is used to remotely connect to other systems while executing commands from the command line

##### HTTP

***hyper text transfer protocol***

used to transfer hypertexts over the internet and it is defined by the **www** or ***world wide web*** for information transfer; this protocol defines how the information needs to be formatted and transmitted and it also defines the various actions the web browsers should take in response to the calls made to access a particular web page; whenever a user opens their web browser, the user will indirectly use HTTP as this is the protocol that is being used to share text, images, and other multimedia files on the www

##### HTTPS

***hyper text transfer protocol secure***

an extension of http; it is used for secure communication over a computer network with the SSL/TLS protocol for encryption and authentication; so, generally, a website has an HTTP protocol but if the website is such that it receives some sensitive information such as credit card details, debit card details, OTP, etc then it requires an SSL certificate installed to make the website more secure

##### TELNET

***terminal network***

standard TCP/IP protocol used for virtual terminal service given by ISO, tis enables one local machine to connect with another; the computer which is being connected is called a remote computer and which is connecting is called the local computer, TELNET operation lets us display anything being performed on the remote computer in the local computer; tis operates on the client/server principle; the local computer uses the telnet client program whereas the remote computer uses the telnet server program

##### POP3

***post office protocol 3***

POP3 has two **MAAs** or ***message access agents*** where one is client MAA and another is server MAA for accessing the messages from the mailbox; this protocol helps us to retrieve and manage emails from the mailbox on the receiver mail server to the receiver’s computer; this is implied between the receiver and the receiver mail server; it can also be called a one-way client-server protocol; the POP3 works on two ports: port 110 and port 995

##### IPv4

***internet protocl version 4***

the most popular version of the internet protocol and is in charge of distributing data packets throughout the network; maximum unique addresses for IPv4 are 4,294,967,296 (232), which are possible due to the use of 32-bit addresses; the network address and the host address are the two components of each address; the host address identifies a particular device within the network, whereas the network address identifies the network to which the host belong; in the “dotted decimal” notation, which is the standard for IPv4 addresses, each octet (8 bits) of the address is represented by its decimal value and separated by a dot e.g. 192.168.1.1

##### IPv6

***internet protocol version 6***

IPv6 was created to address the IPv4 protocol’s drawbacks; a maximum of 4.3 billion unique addresses are possible with IPv4’s 32-bit addresses; contrarily, IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, which enable a significantly greater number of unique addresses, this is significant because IPv4 addresses were running out and there are an increasing number of devices that require internet access; additionally, IPv6 offers enhanced security features like integrated authentication and encryption as well as better support for mobile devices. IPv6 support has spread among websites and internet service providers, and it is anticipated to gradually displace IPv4 as the main internet protocol

##### ICMP

***internet control message protocol***

network protocol that is used to send error messages and operational information about network conditions and is used to help diagnose and troubleshoot issues with network connectivity; ICMP messages are typically generated by network devices, such as routers, in response to errors or exceptional conditions encountered in forwarding a datagram; some examples of ICMP messages include:

- echo request and echo reply or ***ping***
- destination unreachable
- time exceeded
- redirect

ICMP can also be used by network management tools to test the reachability of a host and measure the round-trip time for packets to travel from the source to the destination and back; it should be noted that ICMP is not a secure protocol, it can be used in some types of network attacks like DDoS amplification

##### UDP

***user datagram protocol***

a connectionless, unreliable transport layer protocol; unlike TCP, it does not establish a reliable connection between devices before transmitting data, and it does not guarantee that data packets will be received in the order they were sent or that they will be received at all; instead, UDP simply sends packets of data to a destination without any error checking or flow control; UDP is typically used for real-time applications such as streaming video and audio, online gaming, and **VoIP** or ***voice over internet protocol*** where a small amount of lost data is acceptable and low latency is important; UDP is faster than TCP because it has less overhead; it doesn’t need to establish a connection, so it can send data packets immediately and doesn’t need to wait for confirmation that the data was received before sending more, so it can transmit data at a higher rate

##### IMAP

***internet message access protocol***

used for retrieving emails from a mail server and allows users to access and manage their emails on the server, rather than downloading them to a local device; this means that the user can access their emails from multiple devices and the emails will be synced across all devices; IMAP is more flexible than POP3 as it allows users to access and organize their emails on the server, and also allows multiple users to access the same mailbox

##### SSH

***secure shell***

used for secure remote login and other secure network services and provides a secure and encrypted way to remotely access and manage servers, network devices, and other computer systems; SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the user and encrypt the data being transmitted, making it much more secure than traditional remote login protocols such as Telnet; SSH also allows for secure file transfers using the **SCP** pr ***secure copy*** and SFTP or ***secure file transfer protocol***

##### TLS

***transport layer security***

a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network, such as the internet; the protocol is widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and VoIP, but its use in securing HTTPS remains the most publicly visible

TLS protocol aims primarily to provide security, including privacy, integrity, and authenticity through the use of cryptography, such as the use of certificates, between two or more communicating computer applications; it runs in the presentation layer and is itself composed of two layers: the TLS record and the TLS handshake protocols

##### SSL

***secure socket layer***

SSL uses encryption algorithms to scramble data in transit, preventing hackers from reading it as it is sent over the connection; this information could be anything sensitive or personal which can include credit card numbers and other financial information, names and addresses; the successor to this is TLS
